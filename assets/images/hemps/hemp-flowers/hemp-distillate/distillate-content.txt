*********************CBD Distillate (Cannabidiol) from Hemp*****************

CBD Distillate is a highly refined cannabis extract often derived from high CBD hemp flower and hemp biomass. CBD Distillate typically contains around 80% CBD with the balance including minor cannabinoids, terpenes and other plants oils and extracts. Distillate is also ideal to use in manufacturing of CBD products such as oil tinctures, capsules and vape products.

*********************Wholesale CBD Distillate Oil**************************

DISTILLATES – The final processing step in refinement of extracted oils can be provided in the form of a distillate fraction in which the cannabinoids are isolated into separate fractions from the plant terpenes and flavonoids and any other, less desirable, residuals in the crude oil (chlorophyll, lipids, etc.). 

The resulting oil is very light in color, has almost no taste or aroma, is very consistent, solvent-free and fully decarboxylated. The cannabinoid content is also higher (in the range of 80%) as compared to crude oil. FORMULATION – Some clients desire a crude oil extraction without additional refinement, but also need the THC at compliant levels to be sold as a raw hemp product.Buy Wholesale CBD Distillate Oil, Purchase CBD Distillate Oil , How To Buy Quality CBD Oil , Buying CBD Distillates In Bulk. In this process, we mix our CBD oil with any carrier oil supplied by the customer to reduce the naturally occurring and concentrated THC levels in the crude oil extraction to compliant levels.

**********************Wholesale Crude CBD Oil – ALCOHOL EXTRACTION***********************



ORGANIC ALCOHOL EXTRACTION – Organic Alcohol has been shown to be one of the most effective cannabinoid solvents that can produce an efficient extraction, while retaining high terpene content, and is also safe for consumption in its raw solvent form. Note that this extraction method generally leaves behind the plant waxes, which may have benefits that are favored by some product manufacturers. The alcohol is also a polar solvent.

The non-polar nature of the hydrocarbons and CO2 and as such can also extract less desirable materials from the material – such as chlorophyll. We extract at temperatures below -30deg C to avoid this, but the nature of the solvent at a molecular level is different and should be recognized. ACID OR NEUTRALIZED FORM (AKA DECARBOXYLATION) – Raw cannabis contains the acidic form of the cannabinoids. In our CBD rich hemp, those cannabinoids are primarily CBDA with trace amounts of THCA – both of which are not psychoactive.<br> When controlled heat is applied, the CBDA/THCA molecule loses its carboxylic functional group (COOH) in the form of water vapor and carbon dioxide and become the neutralized forms of the molecules – CBD. This process is called decarboxylation or ‘decarbing’. Smoking or vaporizing cannabis decarboxylates the cannabinoids by the heat of the combustion (or vaporization). If the target product set is for oral ingestion, most clients prefer their product fully decarboxylated (also referred to as ‘activated’).<br> CBD oil products produced with n-Butane or alcohol as the primary solvent can either provided in a non-decarboxylated CBDA ‘dab-grade’ form that is solvent free and terpene rich or in an ‘Activated’ form that is fully decarboxylated. The other extraction methodologies traditionally default to decarboxylated cannabinoids as a result of the distillation processes used.
