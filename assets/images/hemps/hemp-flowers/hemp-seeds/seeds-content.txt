****************************Northern Light (High CBD) Feminised Seeds***************

The Northern Light certainly cannot be left out when discussing the most famous and popular cannabis plants. Northern Light was developed in California and introduced to the Netherlands in the 60’s by Neville Schoenmaker. Northern Light was the basis for the current Dutch ‘nederwiet’, so it truly is a plant the Dutch are proud of. The plant was originally and primarily a 100% Indica Afghani, but later many other hybrids were made with other strains to combine the properties of those strains, such as the longer growth of Sativa plants.

****************************Purple Haze (High CBD) Feminised Seeds*********************

Purple Haze gets its name from the well-known song by Jimi Hendrix and its purple flowers. Purple Haze is not only known for its purple colour, but also an abundance of white trichomes (small resin secreting stalks/hairs) and high potency. In general, the original 100% Sativa Purple Haze is considered a myth, all cannabis strains are said to be able to develop purple flowers under optimal conditions.

******************Dinamed CBD Feminised Seeds****************

This high-CBD strain has the appearance of a sativa-dominant plant with long, thin leaves and well-developed side-branches with an average inter-nodal distance. It is closely related to the medicinal strain Dancehall from which the Pure CBD 4 line was derived. Where night-time temperatures drop significantly it will display lovely purple colours. Another point to note about its appearance is that it has far fewer glandular trichomes on the small leaves and buds due to its low THC production. In contrast it does have far more basal trichomes which secrete CBD; these are much smaller and are therefore less noticeable to the naked eye.
